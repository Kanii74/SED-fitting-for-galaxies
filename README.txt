You are given two files : 21_band.txt and 5_band.txt.

The first file 21_band.txt contains photometric data of two galaxies in the 21 bands, these bands are namely:
1. GALEX          : FUV, NUV
2. SDSS           : u, g, r, i, z
3. VIKING         : Z, Y, J, H, Ks
4. WISE           : W1, W2, W3, W4
5. Herschel PACS  : 100 mu-m, 160 mu-m
6. Herschel SPIRE : 250 mu-m, 350 mu-m, 500 mu-m
There are 43 columns in this file which contain the CATAID (unique ID) of the galaxy, flux observations of the galaxy in 21 bands, and the errors associated with those flux observations. 
All the flux units are in janskys (jy).

The second file 5_band.txt contains photometric data of two galaxies in the 5 SDSS bands. 
There are 11 columns in this file which contain the CATAID (unique ID) of the galaxy, flux observations of the galaxy in 5 bands, and the errors associated with those flux observations.
All the flux units are in janskys (jy).
